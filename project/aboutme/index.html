        <h1> About me </h1>
        <h2> Skate! </h2>
        <p> A fun fact about me is that I have 3 boards: a skateboard, a cruiser and a longboard! I'm not very good at skating though, it's mainly just for fun and cruising around when I'm too lazy to walk or run.
        <div class="skate" id="skate"> </div>

        <h2> Doggos! </h2>
        <p> I really like dogs (although I don't have one myself), so instead I made a game using a dog! </p>
            <p> This works like the t-rex jump game in chrome, but with both obstacles and treats! </p>

                <p> Score: 0</p>

                <li> <p> Press any key to jump and avoid obstacles </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Look out for treats for a bonus! </p> </li></ol>
